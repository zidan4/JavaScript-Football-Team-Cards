# JavaScript-Football-Team-Cards

freeCodeCamp Practice Project.
JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms.

One common aspect of building web applications: processing datasets, and then outputting information to the screen. In this sports team cards project, I learn how to work with DOM manipulation, object destructuring, event handling, and data filtering.

This project will cover concepts like switch statements, default parameters, Object.freeze(), the map() method, and more.
